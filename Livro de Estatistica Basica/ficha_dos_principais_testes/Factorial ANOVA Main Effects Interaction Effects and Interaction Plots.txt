Factorial ANOVA: Main Effects, Interaction Effects, and Interaction Plots

 

Advertisement

Two-way or multi-way data often come from experiments with a factorial design.  A factorial design has at least two factor variables for its independent variables, and multiple observation for every combination of these factors.

 

The weight gain example below show factorial data.  In this example, there are three observations for each combination of Diet and Country.

 

With this kind of data, we are usually interested in testing the effect of each factor variable (main effects) and then the effect of their combination (interaction effect).

 

For two-way data, an interaction plot shows the mean or median value for the response variable for each combination of the independent variables.  This type of plot, especially if it includes error bars to indicate the variability of data within each group, gives us some understanding of the effect of the main factors and their interaction. 

 

When main effects or interaction effects are statistically significant, post-hoc testing can be conducted to determine which groups differ significantly from other groups.  With a factorial experiment, there are a few guidelines for determining when to do post-hoc testing.  The following guidelines are presented for two-way data for simplicity.

 

•  When neither the main effects nor the interaction effect is statistically significant, no post-hoc mean-separation testing should be conducted.

 

•  When one or more of the main effects are statistically significant and the interaction effect is not, post-hoc mean-separation testing should be conducted on significant main effects only. 
(This is shown in the first weight gain example below)

 

•  When the interaction effect is statistically significant, post-hoc mean-separation testing should be conducted on the interaction effect only.  This is the case even when the main effects are also statistically significant.
(This is shown in the second weight gain example below)

 

The final guideline above is not always followed.  There are times when people will present the mean-separation tests for significant main effects even when the interaction effect is significant.  In general, though, if there is a significant interaction, the mean-separation tests for interaction will better explain the results of the analysis, and the mean-separation tests for the main effects will be of less interest.

Two-way ANOVA example with interaction effect

Imagine for this example an experiment in which people were put on one of three diets to encourage weight gain.  The amount of weight gained will be the dependent variable, and will be considered an interval/ratio variable.  For independent variables, there are three different diets and the country in which subjects live.

 

The model will be fit with the lm function, whose syntax is similar to that of the clm function.

 

This kind of analysis makes certain assumptions about the distribution of the data, but for simplicity, this example will ignore the need to determine that the data meet these assumptions.

Simple interaction plot

The interaction.plot function creates a simple interaction plot for two-way data.  The options shown indicate which variables will used for the x-axis, trace variable, and response variable.  The fun=mean option indicates that the mean for each group will be plotted.  For the meaning of other options, see ?interaction.plot.

 

This style of interaction plot does not show the variability of each group mean, so it is difficult to use this style of plot to determine if there are significant differences among groups.

 

The plot shows that mean weight gain for each diet was lower for the UK compared with USA.  And that this difference was relatively constant for each diet, as is evidenced by the lines on the plot being parallel.  This suggests that there is no large or significant interaction effect.  That is, the difference among diets is consistent across countries.  And vice-versa, the difference in countries is consistent across diets.

 

A couple of other styles of interaction plot are shown at the end of this chapter.

 

interaction.plot(x.factor     = Data$Country,
                 trace.factor = Data$Diet,
                 response     = Data$Weight_change,
                 fun = mean,
                 type="b",

Specify the linear model and conduct an analysis of variance

A linear model is specified with the lm function.  Weight_change is the dependent variable.  Country and Diet are the independent variables, and including Country:Diet in the formula adds the interaction term for Country and Diet to the model.

 

The ANOVA table indicates that the main effects are significant, but that the interaction effect is not.

 

model = lm(Weight_change ~ Country + Diet + Country:Diet,
           data = Data)

library(car)

Anova(model,
      type = "II")

Post-hoc testing with lsmeans

Because the main effects were significant, we will want to perform post-hoc mean separation tests for each main effect factor variable.

 

For this, we will use the lsmeans package.  The linear model under consideration is called model, created the lm function above.  The formula in the lsmeans function indicates that pairwise comparisons should be conducted for the variable Country in the first call, and for the variable Diet in the second call.


library(lsmeans)

        pairwise ~ Country,
        adjust="tukey")       ### Tukey-adjusted comparisons

Simple interaction plot

The plot suggests that the effect of diet is not consistent across all three countries.  While Diet C showed the greatest mean weight gain for USA and UK, for NZ it has a lower mean than Diet A.  This suggests there may be a meaningful or significant interaction effect, but we will need to do a statistical test to confirm this hypothesis.


interaction.plot(x.factor     = Data$Country,
                 trace.factor = Data$Diet,
                 response     = Data$Weight_change,

Specify the linear model and conduct an analysis of variance

The ANOVA table indicates that the interaction effect is significant, as are both main effects.

            data = Data)

Post-hoc testing with lsmeans

Because the interaction effect was significant, we would like to compare all group means from the interaction.  Even though the main effects were significant, the typical advice is to not conduct pairwise comparisons for main effects when their interaction is significant.  This is because focusing on the groups in the interaction better describe the results of the analysis.

 

We will use the lsmeans package, and ask for a compact letter display with the cld function.  First we create an object, named marginal, with the results of the call to lsmeans.  Notice here that the formula indicates that pairwise comparisons should be conducted for the interaction of Country and Diet, indicated with Country:Diet.

 

Be sure to read the Least Square Means for Multiple Comparisons chapter for correct interpretation of least square means.  For lm model objects, the values for lsmean, SE, LCL, and UCL values are meaningful.


library(lsmeans)

marginal = lsmeans(model,
                      pairwise ~ Country:Diet,

Interaction plot with error bars using ggplot2

The interaction plots created with the interaction.plot function above are handy to investigate trends in the data, but have the disadvantage of not showing the variability in data within each group.

 

The package ggplot2 can be used to create attractive interaction plots with error bars.  Here, we will use standard error of each mean for the error bars. 


### Create a data frame called Sum with means and standard deviations

library(FSA)

Sum = Summarize(Weight_change ~ Country + Diet,
                data=Data,
                digits=3)

### Add standard error of the mean to the Sum data frame

Sum$se = Sum$sd / sqrt(Sum$n)

Sum$se = signif(Sum$se, digits=3)

### Order levels of the factor; otherwise R will alphabetize them

Sum$Country = factor(Sum$Country,
                     levels=unique(Sum$Country))


### Produce interaction plot

library(ggplot2)

pd = position_dodge(.2)

ggplot(Sum, aes(x = Country,
                y = mean,
                color = Diet)) +
    geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = mean - se,
                      ymax = mean + se),
                   width=.2, size=0.7, position=pd) +
    geom_point(shape=15, size=4, position=pd) +
    theme_bw() +
    theme(axis.title = element_text(face = "bold") +
    scale_colour_manual(values= c("black","red","green")) +
    ylab("Mean weight change")

### You may see an error, “ymax not defined”
###  In this case, it does not appear to affect anything

Interaction plot with mean separation letters manually added

It is common to add mean separation letters from post-hoc analyses to interaction plots.  One option is to add letters manually in either image manipulation software like Photoshop or GIMP, or in a word processor or other software that can handle graphic manipulation. 

 

Letters can also be added to the plot by ggplot2 with the annotate or geom_text options.  See “Optional:  Interaction plot of least square means with mean separation letters” in the Least Square Means for Multiple Comparisons chapter for examples.

 

It is probably more common for means to be lettered so that the greatest mean is indicated with a.  However, lsmeans by default labels the least mean with a.  The order of letters can be reversed manually.
